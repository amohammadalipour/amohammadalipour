### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amirhossein

I'm a Master's student in Biochemistry at the University of Tehran, passionate about understanding the complex molecular machinery of cancer. My goal is to bridge the gap between experimental wet-lab biology and computational in-silico analysis to uncover novel therapeutic strategies.

ðŸ”¬ **My Current Research**

My M.S. thesis focuses on the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer cell plasticity. I am focused on understanding the crosstalk between key intracellular pathways that contribute to the emergence of aggressive, therapy-resistant cell phenotypes.
